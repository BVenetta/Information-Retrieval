    "**Answer:** The closer the precision@10 value is to 1.0 means that the reviewer thought that many of the documents were relevant. However, as mentioned in Task 4 it also shows that when a vague criteria is given to assess whether or not a document is relevant can show different opinions based on the person assessing. In general, when comparing Google and Semantic, Google has a higher mean value of 0.8, whereas Semantic has 0.65. Therefore, it can be said that Google is more able to show relevant documents, in comparison to Semantics."
